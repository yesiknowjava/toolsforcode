Xiaomi today announced two new laptops and they had released a product promotion video online. As a tech enthusiast I got excited and watched the promotion video named __#MakeEpicHappen__.

The two products are:
*       Mi Notebook and 
*       Mi Notebook Horizon Edition

<br />

Both are thin and light, ultra portabe category laptops weighing 1.5kg and 1.35kg respectively. Apart from the weight, there are some key differences between the two. While the Mi Notebook tops out at NVidia MX250, the Mi Notebook Horizon goes a step higher to a NVidia MX350 graphic card. Both variants, base model comes with integrated Intel 620 card as well. 

The laptops have a 14 inch screen with a full hd resolution of 1920 x 1080. The displays are antiglare as well. Coming to the keyboard, xiaomi has used a traditional scissor mechanism keyboard with 1.3 mm of key travel. No number included as its a 14 inch laptop. It also comes with a trackpad that is 11cm x 5.7cm. But we do not know at the present moment, if its based on windows precision drivers. 

Coming to the port selection, both the laptops have a pretty good range of ports including
*   1 x USB Type C
*   2 X USB Type 3.1
*   1 x USB Type 2.0
*   1 X HDMI Port (1.4b)
*   1 X Headphone, Microphone combo port

<br />

The charger is a normal brick, but it supports 65 watt fast charging, that can charge the laptop upto 50% or so in 30 minutes. The other regulars include 8Gb DDR4 ram clocked at 2666Mhz and it also has a 512 GB. From the product images, it seems the RAM is soldered to the motherboard. But we need to confirm the same.

### Pricing
Mi Notebook 14 starts at 42000/- Rs and the Mi Notebook Horizon starts at 55000/- Rs.

### Should we buy
Now the passage below is not technical in any way.

This is my personal opinion and please do read them fully to understand what I mean.

At the present moment, I am able to see a dangerous dragon not just growing, but also venting its fire on the entire world. I can easily see a hitlers germany in the making. Of course I mean the communist Party of China. This is nothing to blame the people of china. The blame is on the pseudo government which has been in power for more than 70 years. In all fairness, its just plain old Fascism coined differently.

Its a well known fact that the government of china uses its companies that do well in foreign countries to push forward their agenda and show their might. They can easily sell phones with the best features possible at a price which no other company in the world can. The chinese government supports these companies. Once the competition is out or is marginalized, the company becomes the front for the chinese government in that country. The chinese government owns many media houses in various countries of the world and they can feed false and loaded information to the people the country. It is happening now and its a shame. 

Even with all the display of immaturity of Donald Trump, he is atleast correct with his current policy with china. We should be very carefull with their practices. We read that the chinese government sent medical supplies to italy. They said its a gift to italy. But was it. It was not a gift and it so much defects that they had to return the products back. They also tried to change the entire story by saying that the corona virus came from itay and not Wuhan China. Of course the attempt failed, but this raises the question of trust worthiness.

Same was the issue when the government of india purchased the medical supplies from china. The engineering samples they sent, passed the quality tests.But when they shipped their actual lot, it was garbage. Many started complaining and china used a lame excuse by saying that the indian government had already approved it and its only the doctors and nurses in india, who are incompetent and their medical supplies were perfect. Again an example as to how cheap the chinese government can get.

Now coming back to technology, as a consumer I was in a dilemma. The brands like Xiaomi, Huawei and the likes of oppo and what not, actually produce good consumer products. I dont get the same features from a samsung (Korean) or an LG. Its not right to ask people not to buy chinese products. That would actually affect the people in china. We dont want that. We want the people to live peacefully there. But we should also make sure that other manufacturers survive. 

Its only up to the manufactures of the various countries of the world, to step up and think in the right direction. We need more competition from local companies. Do we really have to buy even the toilet paper we use from china. What good is a country (i mean any country which imports most of the products from other countries) if it is not self sufficient and self reliant.
